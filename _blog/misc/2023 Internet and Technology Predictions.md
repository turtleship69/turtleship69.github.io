# 2023 Internet and Technology Predictions 
My personal predictions for the Internet and technology in 2023. Throughout the year, I will update this post with how close I was. 
  
## Social Media 
* BeReal either gets bought out, diverges from its current gimmick, or dies. 
* Instagram either wakes up from it's fever dream and reverts back to being instgram, or tries too hard to be like TikTok and dies. 
* Twitter loses its mainstream appeal becoming a pure political shitfest with one sided censorship. 
* Discord continues having an identity crisis no one asked for. 
  
## Computers 
* Apple releases a new Macbook Pro with a M3 that is yet again pretty much the same as the previous generation. 
* Linux and ChromeOS becomes more popular, but still not as popular as Windows. 
  
## Gaming 
* Nothing actually fucking interesting releases. 
* GPU prices continue to be a meme. Intel arc is decent but not great. 
* AMD CPUs overtake Intel in performance, and market share. 
  
## Phones
* iPhone 15 demonstrates how EU are pretty much single handedly regulating the global tech industry. 
* Galaxy s23 will continue to just be good. It Just Worksâ„¢.
