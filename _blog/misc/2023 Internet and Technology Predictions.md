# 2023 Internet and Technology Predictions
My personal predictions for the Internet and technology in 2023. Throughout the year, I will update this post with how close I was. 

## Social Media
* BeReal either gets bought out, diverges from its current gimmick, or dies. 
* Instagram either wakes up from it's fever dream and reverts back to being instgram, or tries too hard to be like TikTok and dies. 
* Facebook stays the same, the main stop for boomers. 
* Twitter either dies or becomes a niche platform. 
* Snap continues to try to be profitable but maintain it's userbase. 
* Absolutely nothhing changed with TikTok, or Reddit. 
* Discord continues to be the best social media platform, but continues having an identity crisis no one asked for. 

## Computers 
* Apple releases a new Macbook Pro with a M3 that is yet again pretty much the same as the previous generation. 
* Windows 11 continues to be a dumpster fire, but becomes the one everyone uses anyway. Windows 10 starts to fade into the background. Windows 7 stans go brr. 
* Linux becomes more popular, but still not as popular as Windows. 

## Gaming 
* The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both successful, but the PS5 is more successful.
* Nothing actually fucking interesting releases. 
* GPU prices continue to be a meme. Intel arc is decent but not great. 
* AMD CPUs overtake Intel in performance, and market share.
  
## Phones
* iPhone 15 is released, and is the same as the iPhone 14 BUT FINIALLY HAS USB-C SDFLDSJGFKL 
* Galaxy s23 will continue to just be good. It Just worksâ„¢. 
* Nothing gets better. 
* Pixel 7a and 8 are out and absolute bangers.
