# The story behind the Yearbook
## This was a fun one


<!--### Intro
So we had a yearbook. We being my school. Well my yeargroup anyway. We were the first ones. And that's because we asked for one. And had to make it --> 

<!--### Initial thoughts
So I first had the idea to have a yearbook like half way through the summer holiday before year 11. --> 

### The form. 
The very first thing we needed to do was fill in a form.  
That's it.  
What do we want in it, how should it look, all that good stuff.  
It took us about 2-3 months, and we were far beyond the deadline they'd set out. ("They" bring the company we were wroking with, hereafter referred to as "The Companyâ„¢".)  
Also, who uses pdf forms? On a school computer, our best bet was to use online pdf editors, and save the file somewhere everytime. We ended up with about 11 versions of that file. And each download was "(1)" more than the last, because apparently counting is hard. So it wasn't `yearbook form (11).pdf`, it was `yearbook form (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).pdf`.  
Overall there was a lot of back and forth within the committee, but we managed to finish it, eventually.  
Let's just not talk about how it was a few months late. 

## The photos
There were a few different photos to collect, but let's start with the most obvious 
### Portraits 
Well these were fun, to say the least.  
First, we had to come up with a plan. Funding was already a concern, so we weren't gonna get professional photographers. So we went for the next best thing: photography students.
